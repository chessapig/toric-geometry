### notes

- section 1: morse theory
	- build topology from fixed points of manifolsd
	- Lemma: even fixed points ==> connected
- section 2: morse theory of moment maps
	- U(1) actions as morse / morse bott functions
	- always even index!! connected level sets
- section 3: proof of convexity
	- connected ==> convexity 
- Misscilania
	- Example: eigenvalues and values of diagonal
