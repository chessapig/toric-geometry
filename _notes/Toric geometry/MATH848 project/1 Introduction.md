# Introduction
A physicist sees the world through harmonic oscillators. The very first thing they study is the motion of a spring, equivalently a particle sitting in a characteristic quadratic potential. They then generalize to quantum mechanics, or to classical field theory and the wave equations, then to the free field in quantum field theory. Reality is merely a perturbed oscillator. Armed with this simple example they completely understand, physicists can tackle much harder problems. 

What then is the geometer's harmonic oscillator? It's not so cut and dry, but I'd argue its the *circle*. The group of circle rotations $U(1)$ is one of the simplest Lie groups, being 1 dimensional and thus abelian. Unlike it's cousin $\RR$, $U(1)$ is compact and has a little bit more meat on its bones. Moving to geometry, you can "rotate" a manifold with a $U(1)$ action, imposing useful symmetries. Taken to its logical extreme, a "toric" manifold has a maximal possible set of independent rotations, encoded by an action by the torus group $U(1)^n$. These manifolds are entirely determined by their rotation structure, which is moreover entirely combinatorial. This is neatly encoded in a polytope, from which you can read off nearly every property you could care about. Toric manifolds are a geometers playground, letting them easily test their ideas. Like the oscillator, it is a simple example which we completely understand. \footnote{At least, more completely than most anything else in geometry.}

The analogous role of toric manifolds and harmonic oscillators is no accident. In the framework of symplectic geometry, a field born form classical mechanics, many circle actions come from harmonic oscillators. I want to show you toric geometry through a physicists glasses, promoting harmonic oscillators to a starring role. As we will see, they give concrete dynamical interpretations to all the big ideas 


In section 2 We'll introduce our protagonists: harmonic oscillators and symplectic geometry. After a digression on Morse theory in section 3, we will prove the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem on the convexity of the moment map image in section 4. Section 5 probes the deeper structure behind the convexity theorem, revealing the delzant polytope of a toric manifold. Section six is the Deusermatt-Hekkmann theorem i guess idk.
